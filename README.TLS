Please note that if nss_ldap or pam_ldap are configured to use TLS, that the
clients will attempt to validate the server's certificate when connecting to
the server.  This includes comparing the subject's name as stored in the
certificate to the value of the "host" configuration option in /etc/ldap.conf
(as usual, the two must exactly match, letter for letter), and validation of
the signature on the certificate against the list of certifying authorities
which the client is configured to trust.
